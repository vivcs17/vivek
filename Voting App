ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "votes_id_key"

----------------------------------------------------------------- 

command:

kubectl delete pod db-b54cd94f4-7nkt9

observation:

when i deleted the DB pod, observed that Result Pod and Worker Pod got restarted.

[root@ip-172-31-25-193 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
db-b54cd94f4-wsvwd        1/1     Running   0          49s
redis-868d64d78-dhfm6     1/1     Running   0          16h
result-5d57b59f4b-vn69f   1/1     Running   1          16h
vote-94849dc97-lthmm      1/1     Running   0          16h
worker-dd46d7584-4f84t    1/1     Running   1          16h

When i checked the reason for Result and worker pod restart, found that Result pod lost the communication with DB pod hence restarted themselves to connect new DB Pod.

Also worker pod also reestablished the connection with DB.

Since DB Pod is placed between Result and worker pod, hence these will always affect if any problem with DB pod.

kubectl describe pods worker-dd46d7584-4f84t

Whenever delete the worker pod, it always re-create by pulling the images from docker hub. Need to see why it's not picked from local.
